# Project Progress & Remaining Tasks

## Completed to Date
- Bootstrapped the React + Vite + TypeScript + Tailwind project and added shadcn/ui primitives, Lucide icons, routing, IndexedDB persistence, zustand stores, template fixtures, dashboard editors, CLI generators, Docker assets, CI skeleton, and updated documentation.
- Began lint cleanup: reordered numerous imports, converted Tailwind config to ESM, replaced interface declarations with type aliases where required, wrapped async event handlers with `void`, and addressed React Refresh warnings in several UI components.
- Adjusted various components to satisfy hook rules (e.g., `CTASection`, `ContactForm`, `SignUpForm`, `DashboardPage` promise handling) and harmonised import grouping across many files.
- Finished lint/typecheck/build/docker validation cycle, converted lingering CommonJS config (PostCSS) to ESM, refactored theme/layout dashboard components, and updated template typing helpers for safer overrides.

## Outstanding Work
- None at the moment.

## Latest Update (2025-10-23)
- Reordered imports in `protected-route`, `theme-provider`, and `theme-toggle`; fixed the stray literal in `theme-toggle`.
- Reworked `DashboardPage` logout handling to keep click handlers synchronous while safely awaiting store actions.
- Migrated `postcss.config` to ESM, renamed layout toggle types to avoid collisions, and rebuilt the theme controls module with clearer typing.
- Added a `DeepPartial` helper for template overrides and adjusted casts so fixtures merge cleanly with defaults without tripping type errors.
- Tidied utility hooks (`animateOnChange` unused param) and ensured lint/typecheck/build all succeed; `docker compose up --build -d` ran successfully and was torn down with `docker compose down`.
- Switched the development/preview ports to 5175/4175, updated Docker, Vite, and docs, and confirmed the CLI generators run cleanly (temporary scaffolds removed afterward).

## Suggested Next Steps
1. Proceed with commit/release or any feature work now that the pipeline is green.
